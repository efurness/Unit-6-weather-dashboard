# Unit-6-weather-dashboard
# city-bike-API


### Description 
The project involved creating a weather dashboard to pull weather from openweathermap.org, a large API with weather information for the present day and future 5 day weather forecast.  I used Bootstrap for the layout including the header and card components.  The API has wide-ranging weather data for cities thoroughout the world.  Successfully, the javascript code brought the objects into the console and then filled the text content using innerText code.  Html tags with id's is where the weather data was populated. The project is a work in progress and can be updated with temperature conversions, right now it uses Kelvin.  The windspeed and UV index did not need conversion, but wind, humidity, and temperature were concatenated with mph, percent and Kelvin.  Percent was added to humidity.  Moment was used for date and time.  This project was enlightening of how an API works.  Please visit again soon!
